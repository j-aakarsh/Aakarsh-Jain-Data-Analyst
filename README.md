6. **Marketing Strategy**:
   - Developed personalized marketing strategies for each cluster:
     - **Cluster 0**: Customers using credit cards from other banks‚Äîtarget with offers to switch to the bank‚Äôs credit card.
     - **Cluster 1**: Low credit card usage‚Äîencourage increased usage with incentives.
     - **Cluster 2 & 3**: High usage‚Äîfocus on loyalty programs and premium offers.
